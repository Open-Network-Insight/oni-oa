# PROXY

oni-oa sub-module for Open-Network-Insight, version 1.1

Proxy sub-module will extract and transform Proxy data already ranked by oni-ml and will load into csv files for presentation layer.

## Proxy Components

###proxy_oa.py

Proxy oni-oa main script.
 
It executes the following steps:

		1. Creates the right folder structure to store the data and the ipython notebooks. This is: 
		
			data: data/proxy/<date>/
			ipython Notebooks: ipynb/proxy/<date>/
		
		
		2. Creates a copy of the notebooks templates into the ipython Notebooks path and renames them removing the "_master" part from the name.
		
		3. Gets the proxy_results.csv from the HDFS location according to the selected date, and copies it back to the corresponding data path.
		 
		4. Reads a given number of rows from the results file.
		 
		5. Checks reputation for the full uri of each connection.
		 
		6. Adds a new column for the severity of each connection.
		 
		7. Translates the 'response code' to human readable text according to the IANA specification. The translated values are stored in the respcode_name column.
		 
		8. Add Network Context.
		
		9. Creates a hash for every full_uri + clientip pair to use as filename.  
		 
		10. Saves proxy_scores.tsv file.
		 
		11. Creates a backup of proxy_scores.tsv file.
		
		12. Creates proxy data details files. 


**Dependencies**

- python 2.7. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) should be installed in the node running Proxy OA. 

	The following modules are already included but some of them require configuration. Please refer to the _components_ documentation for more information. 
- [components/iana](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/blob/1.1/oa/proxy#IANA-iana)
- [components/data](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/blob/1.1/oa/proxy#data)
- [components/nc](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/blob/1.1/oa/proxy#Network-Context-nc)
- [components/reputation](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/blob/1.1/oa/components#Reputation)
- proxy_conf.json

**Prerequisites**

Before running Proxy OA, users need to configure components for the first time. It is important to mention that configuring these components make them work for other data sources as Flow and DNS.

- Configure database engine
- Configure Reputation services
- Configure IANA service
- Configure Network Context service
- Generate ML results for Proxy

**Output**

- proxy_scores.tsv: Main results file for Proxy OA. This file is tab separated and it's limited to the number of rows the user selected when running [oa/start_oa.py](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/tree/1.1/oa).

###proxy_conf.json
This file is part of the initial configuration for the proxy pipeline It will contain mapped all the columns included in the proxy_results.csv and proxy_scores.tsv files.

This file contains three main arrays:

	-  proxy_results_fields: Reference of the column name and indexes in the proxy_results.csv file.	 
	-  proxy_score_fields:  Reference of the column name and indexes in the proxy_scores.tsv file.	
	-  add_reputation: According to the proxy_scores.tsv file, this is the column index of the value which will be evaluated using the reputation services.


### ipynb_templates
After OA process completes, a copy of each iPython notebook is going to be copied to the ipynb/\<pipeline>/\<date> path. 
With these iPython notebooks user will be able to perform further analysis and score connections. User can also
experiment adding or modifying the code. 
If a new functionality is required for the ipython notebook, the templates need to be modified to include the functionality for new executions.
For further reference on how to work with these notebooks, you can read:  
[Edge Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/Open-Network-Insight/oni-oa/blob/1.1/oa/proxy/ipynb_templates/EdgeNotebook.md)
