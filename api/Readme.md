# ONI-OA API 

This module is designed to improve the efficiency and reduce rendering time for the ONI GUI, at the same time allows the system administrator to configure and select the desired database engine to connect and work with to the GUI. 
All the necessary queries for ONI's GUI are already in here, just locate the config/config.json file and update it to match the configuration in your cluster.

## 1. Prerequisites:
* Hadoop 5.4  
* Hive 1.1.0
* Impala 2.2.0
* Python2.7
* pip

**_Note_**: You need to have previously created your HIVE database according to the ONI-OA setup instructions


## 2. Installation & Setup
Install all the required packages:
 
    $ cd your_path/DuxburyBay-Flux/api/
    $ pip install â€“r requirements.txt 
    $ cd api/config 

Update the config.json file accordingly:

- **DBENGINE**: (Options: 'HIVE' || 'IMPALA') 
- **DEFAULT_DATE**: (Default date to use when none was provided in the GUI)
- **DB_HOST**: (DBE Host)
- **PORT**: (Port enabled for the selected DBE instance)
- **AUTH_MECHANISM**: (Options: 'SASL' || 'NOSASL' || 'PLAIN')
- **LDAP_USER**: (Database user)
- **LDAP_PWD**: (Database password) 
- **IANA_CODES**: (Absolute path to IANA codes catalogs) 
- **LDAP_PWD**: (Database password) 


## 3. Usage
This api implements several endpoints to enable the GUI and are accessible by their endpoints:
 
####get_dns_suspicious
Returns top 250 suspicious dns detected by ML, ordered by most suspcious first and only ones that don't have a score set by the security analyst. This endpoint feeds the 'Suspicious' block from suspicious connects.

## 3. Limitations:
This version has only been tested on Impala and Hive2, on a Cloudera distribution for Hadoop.
Only methods for DNS analysis have been implemented, in future versions this api should include methods for different data types.

## 4. Version
* Version 1.0 - Implemented DNS analysis. Compatibility with Impala and Hive2.
